# Andrew.github.io Here is the website that i was working on. Ive been working on it since we did that shoot and it’s only about 40-60% done. I still needed your content and attachments, but I never got the chance I was going to continue working on it and just give it to you later even if we are done seeing each other but it’s just too hard. to make it a working website, you need to make a GitHub I’m not gonna lie the code that I’ve been working on for this website it’s kind of complicated. I was gonna make a tutorial, but I don’t think it would make any sense. you would need to have a very good understanding of python c++ html js etc i’m sure you could get someone fiver to do it if that’s what you wanted, but I didn’t see the point of me just keeping it like it and I hope it opens correctly but I just wanted to give you it even though it wasn’t done I was going to text it to you, but I won’t i’m not gonna reach out anymore. I just makes it harder. you really mean a lot to me take care, Andrew.❤️
